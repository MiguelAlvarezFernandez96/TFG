## Introduction
The MongoDB Service module is responsible for storing data on the ground and retrieving it as requested via MQTT. The module right now offers communications between MongoDB and the Controllers Game from Dashboard Games, allowing to save, load and delete scenarios. The data is stored in a MongoDB database.   
  

## Requirements

Before starting with the installation, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- Python 3.7
- MongoDB Community Edition
- MongoDB Database Tools
- MongoDB Compass (optional, but recommended for easier database management)

## Installation

You can install MongoDB and MongoDB Database Tools from the following links:
- [Install MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/)
- [Install MongoDB Database Tools](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools/)

To make it easier to work with the database, it is also recommended to install [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass).
